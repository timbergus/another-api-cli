# Another API CLI (APIC)

This is another API CLI to manage and create API projects using Node.js and Hapi, using [inquirer.js](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/) to ask questions to the user to configure the creation process.

All is made using plain node without any kind of parser.

Have fun :)
